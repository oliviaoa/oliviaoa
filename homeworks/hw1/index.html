                <li> Something I learned from this article was how to think deeper past the design and how to focus on hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. I also learned how to break down a design instead of analyzing it wholistically. However, the biggest takeway I got from this article was that there is intention behind every element in a design.</li>
                <li> My favorite part of the article was the visual representation the author provided when taking the reader step-by-step in analyzing a design of something. I also enjoy how she added her own thought processes.</li>
