					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> The wireframe for my favorite website: </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wireframe.jpg" alt="Wireframe of My Favorite Website">
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> The redesigned wireframe for my favorite website: </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wireframe2.jpg" alt="Wireframe of My Favorite Website: Redesigned">
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of this website is to share music taste with your friends and social circle. It is intended for teenagers and young adults. The design allows people to focus on their own personal profile and highlights the profile information, while displaying music preferences. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> Spotify's design is already pretty developed. However, I noticed it focuses less on the music taste as a whole, from a general overview, so I added more emphasis on the profile itself, and used hierarchy to move around some things to provide emphasis and aesthetics. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
