                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article was that smooth transitions are important in designs. Additionally, I noticed small design movements within apps that I would not normally notice as a consumer. I was also able to utilize what we learned about color theory through observing these UI interactions. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was really finding the commonalities between different designs, even though the themes may be completely opposite. I also enjoyed the visual components and how I can compare the different interactions all at once. The apps the author chose all varied too, which provided many interesting perspectives. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspirations was the very first one, the welcome screen/login by Andrej Radisic. It was my favorite because its theme was very modern and minimalistic, which is the types of designs I tend to gravitate towards the most. It was able to use a smooth transition as well as contrast to draw viewers to speecific components. I also liked the movement used in the first view of the app. </p>
